    <pre>If I could do it, then why can't you?
Get up and make it work

Yo, if I could do it, then why can't you? (Why?)
Huh, get up and make it work
Ain't no way that I'm sitting around
It's now or never, I'm picking the first (yeah, I'm picking the first)
You can't tell me that I won't make it
Knew that I had this gift since birth (I knew)
Grinding, came out the mud like Roddy
I had nobody, I came from dirt

Still came far 'cause I put in the work (yeah)
Painting a picture when I write lyrics
Don't call me a rapper, I'm really an artist
This weren't by chance or luck, I took one shot and I hit my target (one shot)
I'm not even yet in my prime, I'm not at a hundred yet, I'm still charging (still charging)
They don't wanna see me win but I know in the end I'm winning regardless

Sleepless nights, I was up in the stu'
Up-up in the booth tryna make me a hit
Even when I was feeling low, man, I kept on going, I weren't gon' quit (weren't gon' quit)
I can't wait for the day that I make it
Next in line, man, I feel like a king
My time will come, I just gotta be patient
Keep on pushing and take these risks

I made racks off-putting my pain on tracks
Grinding hard tryna to see more plaques (plaques)
I've been going harder than ever
I don't have time to sit and relax (I don't)
I've been putting in countless hours
I'm still not near where I wanna be at (not yet)
This year I'ma prove them wrong
They said that I can't, but I know that I can

If I could do it, then why can't you?
Huh, get up and make it work
Ain't no way that I'm sitting around
It's now or never, I'm picking the first (yeah, I'm picking the first)
You can't tell me that I won't make it
Knew that I had this gift since birth (I knew)
Grinding, came out the mud like Roddy, I had nobody, I came from dirt

Painting a picture when I write lyrics
Don't call me a rapper, I'm really an artist (more than rap)
This weren't by chance or luck
I took one shot and I hit my target
I'm not even yet in my prime, I'm not at a hundred yet, I'm still charging (still charging)
They don't wanna see me win but I know in the end I'm winning regardless

If I could do it, then why can't you? (Can't you?)
Huh, get up, and make it work

I had nobody, I came from dirt
