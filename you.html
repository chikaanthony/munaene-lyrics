            <pre>I don't want to sing latest song
I don't want to percolate the crowd
I just want to make You smile
I don't care who thinks I'm right or wrong
I don't care who tries to calm me down
I just want to praise you now
You covered me in the midst of it all
You loved me and gave me another chance
You saw my needs
When others saw my faults
You forgave me

… I don't have to listen for my name
They don't have to walk me down the aisle
I just want to make you proud
Should i make the hall of fame
Or they save a special seat
I just hope that You'll be pleased
You covered me in the midst of it all
You loved me and gave me another chance
You rescued me
I was going to fall
You saved me
So in my life
In my life be glorified
Be glorified
In my life
In my life be glorified

… Be glorified

… You get the glory
You get the praise
You take the honor
I just want to say, thank You
You get the glory
You get the praise
You take the honor
I just want to say, thank You
You get the glory
You get the praise
You take the honor
I just want to say
You get the glory
You get the praise
You take the honor
I just want to say
I've come back to say, thank You
Thank You Lord, thank You
I've come back to say thank You
Thank You Lord, thank You
I've come back to say, thank You
Thank You Jesus, thank You
Thank You Lord, thank You

… You get the glory
You get the praise
You take the honor
I just want to say
You get the glory
You get the praise
You take the honor
I just want to say
You get the glory
You get the praise
You take the honor
I just want to say
You get the glory
You get the praise
You take the honor</pre>
